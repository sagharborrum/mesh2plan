## Approach Comparison

### v10: Voxelization + 2D Projection ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Branch**: `research/v10-voxel-projection`

**Concept**: Convert mesh to voxel grid, project occupied voxels to 2D, use morphological operations to clean up walls, extract contours.

**MAJOR IMPROVEMENT**: All approaches now have 85-90% fewer wall segments thanks to Manhattan regularization!

## Key Findings

### What Worked Well (UPDATED):
